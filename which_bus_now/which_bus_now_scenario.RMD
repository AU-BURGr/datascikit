## User scenario
Itâ€™s Friday afternoon and Giraldo is flying to Brisbane. He an ardent environmentalist and refuses to use taxis.He needs to get to the conference centre where his booked to give a talk on ethical sampling, his plane was delayed on take-off and he is running late.

The simplicity of the Nokia 3310 appealed to Giraldo and on a whim he gave away his iPhone after purchasing the Nokia. Unfortunately, the Nokia 3310 cannot run the Brisbane Translink mobile, cursing Giraldo remembers that wife, Rosemary, had created a Twitter bot application that used an R open data package to tweet public transport information, bless her he thought, did it have Brisbane information he wondered.

Earlier in the year, Rosmary, an R enthuiast and Open Data champion had decided to create a command line tool that returned public transport information for Brisbane. During a workshop held by her local chapter the group had refined Rosemary's idea. The effort is the code that we will be examining.

Using the datascikit package help Girlado get to his conference.
