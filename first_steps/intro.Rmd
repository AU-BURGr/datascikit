> *Bus* or *Omnibus*, from the Latin *omnibus*, meaning "to or for, by, with or from everyone"

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. Like the other Notebooks in this package, it contains a self-learning data science tutorial. This series of tutorials is based around public transport data.  We will work with data from Southeast Queensland, Australia, but you can probably run many of the the examples on data from your city. 

We will start with 'static GTFS data'.  [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) is a standard format specification for public transit timetables and routes.   The SE Queensland data are available from [Translink](https://data.qld.gov.au/dataset/general-transit-feed-specification-gtfs-seq/resource/be7f19e5-3ee8-4396-b9eb-46f6b4ce8039).  They are also in the file `../static_data/SEQ_GTFS.zip`.   The data are in a series of CSV files (but with `.txt` extensions)

# Reading in the stop locations

First, we unzip the supplied file into a temporary directory. The temporary direction will be deleted when you quit R.
```{r}
staticGTFS<-tempdir()
unzip("../static_data/SEQ_GTFS.zip",exdir=staticGTFS) #FIXME will use package.file() eventually
list.files(staticGTFS)
```

```{r}
stops<-read.csv(paste(staticGTFS,"stops.txt",sep="/"))
summary(stops)
```
